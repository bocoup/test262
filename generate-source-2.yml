# 2-dimensional array where each item has the following string elements:

# - feature name
# - directory "glob" pattern

# This can optionally be followed by a filtering rule--either:

# - an item with the literal value "files" followed by at least one file
#   pattern, or
# - an item with the literal value "tags" followed by at least one tag pattern
#
# Omitting a filtering rule implies that all files in the directory and its
# subdirectories are matches.
